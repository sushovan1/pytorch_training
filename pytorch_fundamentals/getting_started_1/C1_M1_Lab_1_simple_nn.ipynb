    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You've successfully built and trained your first PyTorch model to solve the initial delivery problem. You saw how a **linear model** could learn the relationship in simple bike-only data to make a correct, data-driven decision. However, the true lesson came when this model failed on a more complex dataset containing both bikes and cars. This revealed a key concept: a simple linear model, no matter how well-trained, can only learn straight-line patterns and struggles when reality becomes **non-linear**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This challenge perfectly sets the stage for your next lesson, where you will learn how to give your models the ability to learn curves, not just lines. By working through the essential stages of the **Machine Learning Pipeline** in this lab, you have built a solid foundation. Understanding where and why this simple model fails is the crucial first step toward building more advanced networks capable of solving truly complex problems."
